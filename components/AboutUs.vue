        Hi, we’re Maya and Colin, the developers behind Mivory! When we first started dating, we loved
        sharing recipes, video ideas, and coding tools with each other. But over time, we found it hard to
        remember where we saved specific posts or shared our favorite finds. That’s when the idea for
        Mivory was born! It became such a time-saver for us that, after a year of using it ourselves, we
        decided to share it with the world. We hope it helps you as much as it’s helped us!
